# Data Analysis on DataCo Supply Chain

Welcome to my Data Analysis project on the **DataCo Supply Chain** dataset.  
In this project, I leveraged **SQL** and **Power BI** to explore real-world supply chain data, uncover hidden patterns, and create powerful visualizations that support data-driven decision-making.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

This project aims to address key challenges in supply chain management through the following analyses:

### 1. Inventory Analysis  
Understand inventory levels and turnover rates across different product categories.  
✅ Helps identify which items are slow-moving or overstocked, and optimize stock levels to reduce stockouts.

### 2. Shipment Delay Analysis  
Investigate the main reasons behind shipment delays.  
✅ Track shipping performance and detect opportunities to improve delivery speed and efficiency.

### 3. Late Delivery Trends  
Analyze how late delivery rates change over time.  
✅ Identify months or regions with high delay percentages to act upon.

## 📦 Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes:
- Customer and product information
- Order and shipment details
- Delivery status
- Departments, categories, and time-based fields

## 📊 Insights Generated

- Which markets have the highest rate of late delivery?
- What’s the average shipping delay time per product or region?
- How seasonal patterns affect shipment performance?
- Which departments or product categories need better inventory control?
